Express Gateway is a microservices API gateway that sits at the heart of any microservices or serverless architecture, regardless of what language or platform you're using.

Express Gateway secures your microservices and serverless functions and expose them through APIs using Node.js, Express and Express middleware.

Developing cloud native applications, orchestrating and managing them now can be done insanely fast all on one seamless platform without having to introduce additional infrastructure.

> **PROJECT STATE NOTICE**
This project is a fork of [Express Gateway](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway) which is **DEPRECATED**

This fork has large segments of functionality removed (eg all the project generation / scaffolding features).  Its purpose is to provide dependency updates addressing potential dependency security issues, until projects running express-gateway can be migrated.
